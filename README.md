ABSTRACT
Diffuse atomic gas permeating and surrounding galaxies constitutes a large fraction of galactic baryonic mass. When these gas clouds are gravitationally accreted, they can interact with the interstellar medium and contribute significantly to the galactic star formation rate \cite{RichterPaper}. We focus on determining the spatial extent and kinematics of these gas structures along lines of sight to Messier 83. We employ absorption line spectroscopy and analyze 126 spectra of lines of sight oriented inside and surrounding Messier 83. We measure the absorption line strengths and calculate column densities of ionized Ca II gas observed around the Milky Way and Messier 83 along these lines of sight. We study the small scale variation in the density and masses of the gas clouds and observe several cloud structures orbiting Messier 83 and the Milky Way. We will present a preliminary model for the thickness and extent of the cloud assuming constant density. In the future, we look to extend this research to parameterize the accretion rate of the gas structures surrounding Messier 83 and the Milky Way.

Most of my code is uploaded here. One of the main preliminary files I have is too big to upload, so it was omitted. I attempted to split it into 2 smaller files, but the code did not work without the whole file. You can see how I coded for a number of figures and findings I included in my research paper and poster.
